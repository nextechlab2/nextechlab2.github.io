				<h2>Intro to Game Development and XR</h2>
				<p>"Intro to Gamedev and XR" is a free to attend Technical Talk, conducted by 'Next Tech Lab' members in association with Unity and ACM Students Chapter & ACM-W Chennai Chapter, SRMIST-Kattankulathur Campus. This event is intended for people who are curious about game development and emerging technologies such as Augmented Reality, Mixed Reality, and Virtual Reality but have little to no experience. 

With industries rapidly adopting extended reality technologies and as consumers spend more time and money in gaming, game developers are in high demand in the industry right now and this demand is only expected to increase in future. In this technical session, we introduce people to Unity game engine and provide guidelines that might help them convert their ideas into video games.We would also show the process to make their first Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality applications and explore various use cases pertaining to XR.At the end of the talk, the audience can expect to have a better sense of the game development industry and the Extended Reality industry and enough knowledge to pick up game dev or XR dev on their own.</b></p>
